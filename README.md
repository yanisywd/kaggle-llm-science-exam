#Foundational Approach to Kaggle's LLM Science Exam Challenge

In this repository, I present a foundational approach to tackling the Kaggle LLM Science Exam problem. By using the well-acknowledged transformer architecture, specifically the Roberta model, I aimed to provide a stable starting point for the challenge.

Strategy Breakdown:

Choice of Roberta: While Roberta is a robust model known for its performance in NLP tasks, it serves as a strong starting point. By fine-tuning using the roberta-base weights, I've leveraged its pre-existing knowledge for our dataset.

Tokenization: The Roberta tokenizer was utilized to process the dataset. The questions and options were merged using a [SEP] token to provide a holistic context to the model.

Data Management: After tokenization, the data was structured into PyTorch tensors and segmented into a training-validation set (90-10 split). This split aimed to avoid overfitting while ensuring validation accuracy.

Training: The model underwent training for 10 epochs with the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of 2e-5. I integrated a learning rate scheduler based on validation accuracy to promote an adaptive learning process.

Validation: Post-training, the model's performance was evaluated on the validation set. Keeping track of misclassifications serves as a window into potential areas of improvement.

Prediction: For the test set, top-3 predictions were generated for each question, in line with the competition's requirements.

Room for Improvement:
While this approach sets a stable foundation, there's significant room for enhancements:

Model Ensembling: Combining predictions from multiple models can potentially boost accuracy.
Hyperparameter Tuning: A more exhaustive search for optimal parameters might further improve performance.
Data Augmentation: Utilizing techniques like back translation could enrich our training dataset, potentially improving model robustness.
Concluding Thoughts:
This repository offers a basic but competent strategy for the Kaggle LLM Science Exam. It's an amalgamation of my preliminary understanding of the challenge and the capabilities of transformer models. However, it should be noted that while this serves as a solid starting point, for benchmark-setting results, further refinement, and additional strategies would be essential.
