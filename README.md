Foundational Approach to Kaggle's LLM Science Exam Challenge
In this repository, I present a foundational approach to tackling the Kaggle LLM Science Exam problem. By utilizing the acknowledged transformer architecture, especially the Roberta model, I aimed to offer a stable starting point for this challenge.

Strategy Breakdown:
Choice of Roberta: Using Roberta, a powerhouse in NLP, was a strategic starting point. By fine-tuning it with the roberta-base weights, the model was geared towards our specific dataset.

Tokenization: Leveraged the Roberta tokenizer for dataset processing. The union of questions and options via a [SEP] token aims to give the model a unified context.

Data Management: Post-tokenization, data was converted into PyTorch tensors and divided into a training-validation split (90-10 ratio) to mitigate overfitting and ensure validation accuracy.

Training: Engaged in a 10-epoch training using the AdamW optimizer and a 2e-5 learning rate. Incorporated a learning rate scheduler, adjusting based on validation accuracy.

Validation: Post-training, the model was gauged against the validation set, with misclassifications hinting at areas of potential enhancement.

Prediction: Predictions for the test set were extracted, with the top 3 predictions being pinpointed for every question, resonating with the competition's guidelines.

Room for Improvement:
While the approach is foundational, there's a wide scope for augmentations:

Model Ensembling: Merging predictions across models can be a potential game-changer for accuracy.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Rigorous exploration for optimal parameters might yield better outcomes.
Data Augmentation: Techniques like back translation can diversify the training dataset, potentially bolstering model resilience.
Concluding Thoughts:
This repository serves as an introductory strategy for the Kaggle LLM Science Exam. It's a blend of my early understanding of the challenge combined with the prowess of transformer models. It's pertinent to note that while this provides a solid foundation, achieving benchmark-setting outcomes demands further refinement and nuanced strategies.
