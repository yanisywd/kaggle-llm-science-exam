## ðŸ›  Strategy Breakdown

### Choice of Roberta 
Utilizing Roberta, a known entity in NLP, was a deliberate initial step. Fine-tuning it with the `roberta-base` weights makes it tailor-suited for our dataset.

### Tokenization
Employed the Roberta tokenizer. Merging questions with options using a [SEP] token gives the model a combined context.

### Data Management
Post-tokenization, data is transformed into PyTorch tensors. There's a 90-10 training-validation split to counteract overfitting.

### Training
Engaged in a 10-epoch training cycle using the AdamW optimizer and a 2e-5 learning rate. Also integrated a learning rate scheduler that's validation accuracy-centric.

### Validation
The model's prowess is tested against the validation set. Misclassifications offer a direction for refinement.

### Prediction
Predictions on the test set are shaped, spotlighting the top 3 predictions per question, as per competition stipulations.

## âš¡ Room for Improvement

While foundational, numerous enhancements can be explored:

1. **Model Ensembling:** Merging predictions from diverse models might amplify accuracy.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Deep-dive exploration for the best parameters can be fruitful.
3. **Data Augmentation:** Techniques like back translation can bolster the dataset's richness, potentially amplifying model robustness.

## ðŸ“£ Concluding Thoughts

This repository reflects a nascent strategy for the Kaggle LLM Science Exam. Marrying the challenge's requirements with transformer models' capabilities lays down a base. Yet, for pinnacle performance, additional refinements and strategies are essential.
